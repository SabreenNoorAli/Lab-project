## what precisely you have accomplished since the last progress report

Still couldn't get the correct path to read teh data from external server. 
Scheduled consultation. 

## any necessary revisions to your product moving forward

Not at the moment. I think I can accomplish atleast combining the files into one big data file. 

## anticipated timelines for the remaining components of your product

Feb 21th: Get the files in one sheet by next week.
Feb 28st: Get the variables out of the sheets
March 6th: Start the corealtion analysis
