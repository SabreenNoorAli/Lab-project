## what precisely you have accomplished since the last progress report

Worked on creating Git Repo. 
Added code chunk with code to get the file path

## any necessary revisions to your product moving forward

Not at the moment. I think I can accomplish atleast combining the files into one big data file. 

## anticipated timelines for the remaining components of your product

Feb 14th: Get the files in one sheet by next week.
Feb 21st: Get the variables out of the sheets
Feb 28th: Start the corealtion analysis
